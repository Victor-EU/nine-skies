# Prototype findings — phase 0

2026-09-20 · running log for gate G1

Findings from building the foundations, the D3/D4 spike and the horizon
impostor. Each one is a decision the build plan needs to absorb, not a bug
report.

## F1 — The impostor is a plateau feature, not an approach feature

**This finding replaces two earlier versions, and the corrections matter more
than the finding**, because the build plan was about to be changed on the
first one.

The first version said: the plateau wall is 564 km ahead from the Sichuan
Basin, the terrain cache draws 384 km, therefore Expedition 1's signature
moment — "the plateau rising like a wall ahead" — cannot render, therefore the
impostor must land before the G1 playtest or the gate fails for the wrong
reason. The premises are true; the conclusion is not. A wall only looks like a
wall from close to it, and close enough is inside the cache.

**Geometry.** Apparent angle above the horizon, flying 900 m above local
ground along the Sea to Sky corridor at 1:8 and 1.5×:

| Inland | Wall ahead | Streamed terrain | With impostor | Impostor adds |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2,000 km | 1,312 km | below the eye | +0.25° | first sighting |
| 2,200 km | 1,112 km | −3.13° | +1.12° | 4.24° |
| 2,400 km | 912 km | −3.60° | +1.35° | **4.95°** |
| 2,600 km | 712 km | −0.12° | +2.83° | 2.95° |
| 2,760 km (basin) | 552 km | +1.31° | +3.24° | 1.92° |
| 2,900 km | 412 km | +3.88° | +4.25° | 0.37° |
| 3,000 km | 312 km | +4.04° | +4.08° | — |

The reveal — the wall going from a line on the horizon to something filling
the windscreen — happens between roughly 300 km and 100 km out, and **300 km
is inside the streamed radius**. So the second version said: the impostor buys
the approach rather than the arrival, peaking around 2,400 km inland where the
streamed horizon sits below the eye and there is nothing above it but sky.

That was also wrong, and fixing F9 is what showed it. Geometry is only half of
visibility; the other half is how much air is in the way. Measured by
framebuffer readback, impostor on versus off, out of 765 possible units of
channel difference:

| Looking from | Region density | Impostor height | Contrast against sky |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Uplands, 2,400 km | 2.8e−5 | **4.44°** | 32 — a whisper |
| Sichuan Basin, 2,760 km | 5.2e−5 | 1.09° | 13 — invisible |
| Plateau edge, 3,400 km | 6.8e−6 | 0.57° | 96 |
| Plateau, 3,900 km | 6.8e−6 | 1.01° | **102 — a hard white ridge** |

The approach has the angle and none of the contrast: 900 km of lowland air in
late autumn eats the plateau completely, which is exactly what it does in
life. The plateau has almost no angle and all of the contrast, because the air
up there is glass — so the Himalaya arrive as a crisp white line against deep
blue, and without the impostor that is empty sky.

**So the impostor belongs to Expedition 7, not Expedition 1.** Standing on the
plateau and seeing the Himalaya 450–1,150 km off is the thing it draws that
nothing else can.

**Action.** Keep it: it is built, it costs one draw call, and it carries the
destination of the expedition the GDD ends on. Do **not** gate G1 on it — that
was the wrong conclusion twice over. `H` toggles it in the prototype so the
cohort can answer the question instead of us guessing.

**And a process note worth more than the finding.** Three versions, and each
correction came from building the thing and measuring it, not from thinking
harder. The first two readings were made from screenshots and arithmetic; the
one that held up came from reading the framebuffer. Numbers that decide plan
changes should come from the frame buffer.

## F2 — 384 km is a floor, not a budget

The GDD's performance table quotes 120 km of view distance, and the risk
register's mitigation for "browser cannot hold the plateau view distance" is
to reduce it to 90 km. Measured, at the heart of the approach:

| Inland | 384 km view | 90 km view |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2,900 km | +3.88° | −1.86° |
| 3,000 km | +4.04° | −3.39° |
| 3,100 km | +3.97° | −1.39° |
| 3,200 km | +2.87° | +0.13° |

At 90 km the plateau is not smaller, it is **gone** — the horizon drops below
the eye and the windscreen is ground and sky. That mitigation would delete the
moment it was meant to protect.

The near field is the load-bearing part, which is the opposite of what the
first draft of F1 assumed. So the order to cut in is: impostor shells first
(they carry anticipation, and the world degrades to what it is today), then
LOD detail, and the near radius last and never below about 300 km.

**Action.** Split the GDD's performance target — near field ~380 km at full
LOD, impostor horizon to 1,200 km — and rewrite the risk register mitigation
in that order. 1,200 km is not arbitrary: the plateau first clears the horizon
at 2,000 km inland with the wall 1,312 km off, so a shorter reach clips the
first sighting and a longer one draws ground nobody can see.

## F3 — Expedition 1's climb budget only closes if the climb starts at Shanghai

**Measured**, and locked into a test (`test/sim/flight.test.ts`). Flying full
climb at cruise:

| Climb starts at | Distance to Lhasa | Altitude on arrival |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shanghai (0 m) | 2,980 km | above 4,500 m — fits, ~15 % margin |
| Chongqing (1,000 m) | 1,540 km | below 4,500 m — does not fit |

Altitude is the one axis that is not compressed, so the horizontal gain does
not help. About 84 % of the expedition is spent climbing.

This is the right answer rather than a problem — it is the thesis in the
controls — but it has three consequences:

- Expedition 1's autopilot must begin climbing on the eastern plain, not at the
  mountains. Route authoring has to encode that.
- A player who takes the stick and dawdles over the Three Gorges arrives below
  the plateau rim. Terrain contact bounces rather than crashes, so it is not
  fatal, but it will feel bad. The rejoin behaviour should restore altitude,
  not just heading.
- The per-leg speed mode the GDD already allows is the tuning lever: dropping
  the western legs to low speed buys climb time without touching the physics.

## F4 — Tuning that came out of the aircraft, and what it buys

The aircraft was tuned to one target: a service ceiling just above Everest base
camp. Everything else followed.

| | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Service ceiling | 6,197 m |
| Climb rate, sea level | 7.1 m/s |
| Climb rate, plateau (4,500 m) | 2.1 m/s |
| Boost cut-out | 3,564 m (stated as density ratio 0.70, not as an altitude) |
| Cruise turn radius, coast → plateau | 141 m → 222 m |
| Cruise ground speed, coast → plateau | 130 → 163 km/min |

The ceiling does a lot of teaching for free: Namtso (4,718 m) and Everest base
camp (5,150 m) are reachable, and the summit (8,849 m) is not — so the player
looks *up* at Everest, which is what you actually do. Expedition 7 depends on
this, and `test/sim/aircraft.test.ts` fails if the ceiling drifts out of band.

## F5 — Cards will quote colder numbers than the GDD prose does

The GDD's Ice to Coconuts describes "Harbin at -25 °C, Sanya at 25 °C". Those
are closer to January daily minima than to monthly normals — the normals are
about -18 °C and 22 °C. The build plan's rule is that a card's figure must match
what the HUD showed, and the HUD will read the normal.

**Action.** A note for content production, not a code change: either the cards
quote normals and the prose follows, or the cards explicitly say "January mean
daily minimum". Worth settling before 230 cards are written to the wrong
convention.

## F6 — The haze model could not express 600 km

Aerial perspective was sampled at the far end of the sight line:
`exp(-targetHeight / H)`. Over a 384 km world that is close enough. Over a
1,200 km one it is not: the line of sight to a 4,500 m ridge spends almost all
of its length in the thick air *below* that ridge, and taking only the ridge's
own height made distant mountains arrive as clean, dark cut-outs pasted on the
sky — the single worst thing a horizon impostor can look like.

The fix is a closed form, not a march: for an exponential atmosphere the mean
density along a straight path is the integral of `exp(-y/H)` between the two
heights, divided by the height difference. Two exponentials, and distance
reads on its own.

The densities also had to be retuned — they were fitted against a world a
third as deep — and the retune is what exposed F7.

## F7 — The region atmosphere table was written and never connected

`SPIKE_REGIONS` held three parameter sets from the start and nothing read
them; the prototype ran one global density everywhere. That was invisible
while the world stopped at 384 km and obvious the moment it did not, because a
single density makes every region's horizon look the same — and "the plateau's
air is clean and its horizon is hard" is the first thing the GDD promises
about the destination.

Now blended at the aircraft from three stand-in region weights. This is **not**
D14, which blends nine sets by per-pixel region weight and drives music and
card triggers from the same numbers. It is the smallest thing that lets the
playtest see the intended look: the basin reads as milk, the plateau reads as
glass, and the invariant that the haze colour and the clear colour are the
same value means terrain fading into the distance lands exactly on the sky.

**Action.** D14 stays scheduled. Nothing here anticipates its interface.

## F8 — The hypsometric ramp had the snow line 1,600 m too low

The ramp blended to snow from 3,800 m, which painted the entire Tibetan
Plateau as an ice sheet — Expedition 7's players would have arrived somewhere
that does not exist. Permanent snow on the plateau starts around 5,400 m. The
ramp now runs plateau → alpine → snow with the transition there.

Land cover (workstream A step 7) supersedes the whole ramp, so this is
temporary. It is worth recording anyway, because it is the first case of the
rule that the GDD sets and this project has to keep: **a colour stop is a
factual claim.** A ramp is a small map legend, and a wrong stop is a wrong map.

## F9 — The shaders were writing linear colour to an sRGB framebuffer

The one that was hiding under everything else. three converts the clear colour
from the linear working space on its way to the screen; it does not touch a
custom `ShaderMaterial`'s output. The terrain and impostor shaders were
computing in linear and writing it raw. So at full haze, ground landed on
**(149, 167, 195)** while the sky it was fading into cleared to
**(199, 212, 229)** — a hard 50-unit seam along the horizon, in the one place
this game cannot afford one, in every screenshot taken so far.

The ramp constants had been picked by eye, which means they were sRGB, and
were being consumed as linear. That cancelled out for unlit ground, which is
why the terrain looked broadly right and the bug survived the whole spike.

Fixed by converting in both directions in the shared chunk: ramp stops in,
display encoding out, lighting and haze in linear between them. The haze
densities then had to be retuned a second time, because the first tuning had
been compensating for a haze colour that was landing half as bright as it
should.

**This was invisible to every test in the suite and will stay invisible**, and
CI has no GPU to catch it. It took a framebuffer readback to see it. The
readback probe used here should become a tool in the repo before G1 rather
than a thing retyped into a console.

## Spike result: D3, D4 and the impostor

Measured in Chrome on the development machine (not the Iris Xe floor device,
which is still the number that counts):

| | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Draw calls, 137 visible tiles | **3** (one per occupied LOD bucket) |
| Terrain triangles | 218k–261k, against a 1.2 M budget |
| Impostor | **1 draw call, 6,144 triangles** (0.4 % of budget), one shared shader |
| Horizon march | 2.6 ms full sweep, sliced to **0.6 ms/frame** over eight frames, every 25 km |
| Coarse global field | 657 × 433 Int16 = **556 kB**, built in 126–185 ms at boot |
| Frame rate | 65–120 fps (vsync-capped) |
| Heightmap path | R16I texture array, `texelFetch` in the vertex shader — works |
| Flat shading | Screen-space derivatives of world position — works, no normal attribute |

Verified by framebuffer readback rather than by eye — which is also how F9 was
found, and how the first two versions of F1 were shown to be wrong.

Two things the build should not forget:

- The floor device measurement is still outstanding and is the one that decides
  whether the 4 ms L0 trip-wire in the risk register is hit. Everything above
  is a development machine.
- The world is a flat plane. On a sphere, ground 560 km away sits 25 km below
  the tangent plane and the horizon from 1,200 m is 138 km, so none of the
  approach above would be visible at all. Every flight game at this scale makes
  this trade; this one claims geographic faithfulness in its first sentence, so
  the departure belongs on the record rather than in the shader.
